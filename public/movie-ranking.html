 <h1>The Best Movies According to Patricia</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Singing in the Rain</h3>
 <p>This movies is the pinicle of the golden age of musicals. 
    It has big memorable song and dance numbers and enough comedy to keep you entertained. It is a true classic
     and a must watch at least once for any movie buff.</p>  
 <h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
 <p>The characters of this movie are cliches in the most charming way.
    Growing up in the 80's this story highlights the social separation that
    dominated high school life but brings a spark of hope for understanding.
 </p> 
 <h3>Ladyhawke</h3>
 <p>Just a good movie.</p> 
 
 <h2>Top 3 Superhero Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Iron Man</h3>
 <p>An actor I like and a comic hero I knew nothing about made for a perfect match. </p>  
 <h3>Gardians of the Galaxy</h3>
 <p>What can I say but fun. </p> 
 <h3>Batman (1989)</h3>
 <p>Dare I say that Michael Keaton was the best of the buch when it comes to the list of actor that have 
    portrayed this iconic superhero? Pair him with the villony of Jack Nicholson and you get one good movie.

 <h2>Top 3 Movies I Didn't think I Would Like But Did</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
 <p>I was forced to go see this movie with no hint of what it was about. The film easily sucks the viewer
     in with it's musice and dancing that supports the drama of the main story.</p>  
 <h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
 <p>Marvel Comic's Doctor Strange is not a character I was ever familiar with. However, hearing that 
    the Doctor would be a key figure other movies in the Marvel franchise, I decided
    I needed to watch it. I was surprised by the comedy and acting skills of the cast.
 </p> 
 <h3>Flatliners</h3>
 <p>I don't like horror movies, but this one is much more of a thriller. The cast is great and 
    the story compelling enough to make me jump out of my seat without the overwhelming gore so popular today.
